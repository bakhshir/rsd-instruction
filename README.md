## Keep your output up to date
It is essential that we can always show our up to date output. Please make sure to regularly add new software, publications, talks, news items, presentations, conference papers or anything else that can be considered project output.

For most completed projects, a list of publications can be found in the end report:
* Find project in [Sharepoint](https://nlesc.sharepoint.com/sites/operations/Shared%20Documents/Projectportfolio)
* `Project` / `E - End documents` / `Wetenschappelijk en financieel report` (Scientific and financial report).

If there are any publications not in the end report, please add them too!

*If you cannot find an end report and the project is finished, please report it to Noura.*

## Questions
Unclear what to do with your Zotero entry? You can add the tag `FIXME`, and we will have a look at it. If your question is not directly related to an entry, check the [closed issues](https://github.com/NLeSC/rsd-instruction/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=), or [add a new one](https://github.com/NLeSC/rsd-instruction/issues/new) if it is not yet listed

## Zotero
*Note: Use the **offline** version of Zotero, the web client functionality is very limited, can't add by DOI etc.*
* [Create account](https://www.zotero.org/user/register/)
*Note: if you use Lastpass and register, it will **not** popup and ask to save the password, so save it beforehand!*
* Login
* Go to [Netherlands eScience group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1689348/netherlands_escience_center)
* Click `join`
* [Download Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/)
* Install Zotero

In Zotero:
* Go to `edit`/`Preferences`/`Sync`
* Enter username & password -> OK
* Click sync button ![Instruction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NLeSC/TEAM/master/RSD/images/step1.png)
* Netherlands eScience Center should appear under `Group Libraries`.

### Open project
* Click  `Netherlands eScience Center` / `Group Libraries`.
* Zotero projects are not searchable; it's easiest to find the project id at [the bottom of this document](#projects), and use it to find your project.

If you have papers that are not directly connected to a project, but which are linked to the eScience Center, please add them to the `Miscellaneous` folder (on the same level as `Projects`

### Adding items
Items can be added by DOI (preferred), or manually if there is no DOI.
Most entry boxes in Zotero supply a drop down menu with suggestions after typing a few letters.

1. Synchronize with the Zotero server (top right of the window, the reload button)
2. Create a new item:
   * If you have a DOI, click `Add item(s) by Identifier` ![Instruction2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NLeSC/TEAM/master/RSD/images/step2.png). Enter one or more DOI(s), separated with a space.
   * Items without a DOI can be added from `File` -> `New Item` -> `'type'`.
3. Check if the metadata in the `Info` tab is correct:
   * In the right-hand panel, select the `Info` tab
   * Check the `Item Type` (top of the list)
   * Depending on the item (see the list below) fill in the `Type` (near the top of the list) and/or `Extra` (near the bottom of the list) fields.
4. To distinguish our `domain` and `escience` output, please add a tag:
   * In the right-hand panel, select the `Tags` tab
   * Add a tag `domain` or `escience`
5. After adding you items, synchronize with the Zotero server again.

#### About names
Please check if the names are entered correctly in for instance the `Author` or `Programmer` fields.
We are using the `firstname`, `lastname` format, where each is in its own input field.
You can switch between single and two field entry by pressing the small button next to the names.
Prefixes (`de`, `van der`, etc.) should be included in the lastname so for `Jan de Groot` use lastname `de Groot`.

#### About dates
Please refrain from using date ranges (eg. no `4-5th december 2013`), and just use a single date (the first day of the range).
To differentiate days from months, please use `yyyy-mm-dd`, or `mm-dd-yyyy`. If the year is last it will be parsed as `mm-dd-yyyy` and zotero will also show it as such, so **`dd-mm-yyyy` will not parse correctly**.
If the day is unknown, use `mm yyyy`, eg `05 2014` for May 2014.

### Types of output
Below is a list of output we would like to keep track of, with a short description.
Pick the one that best describes your output, and fill out the metadata required.
By default Zotero shows a much larger list of metadata, please fill out the others entries as good as possible.

If you have an item that doesn't fit, please [open an issue in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/NLeSC/rsd-instruction/issues/new) and we'll figure it out & update this document.

#### Papers
These are peer reviewed papers, and typically have a DOI already.
If you do not have a DOI yet, for instance, when the paper is under submission or in preparation, add it as a [Manuscript](#manuscript) first.
Once you have a DOI, add the paper as `Journal Article` or `Conference Paper` and remove the manuscript entry.
Depending on the domain, there may be differences between the two categories, please choose the one most representative for your paper.

#### Software
For software, there are two separate cases:
1. Software that is written by us, and that has a clear separate repository. We have (or can get) a DOI for the software.
2. External software that we made a (significant) contribution to, or software we cannot (or do not want) to get a separate DOI for.

Other cases, like bug fixes or minor features, do not have to be added to the RSD.

*Case 1:*

* Get a DOI for software via [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). Anything with a GitHub repository can be added. If that is not possible, you can upload a (zip) file of the source code or repository instead.
* Wait until the DOI has been synchronized through Crossref.org (It can take a couple of hours after creating a Zenodo DOI before it is available).
* Add software to project by its DOI.
* On the `Info` tab, make sure that the `Item Type` is set to `Computer Program`. _NOTE: The DOI should now have (automagically) appeared at the `Extra` field_

*Case 2:*

* add a new item with `Computer Program` as `Item Type`.
* On the `Info` tab, fill in the `Title` field  and set the `URL` to the Github URL.
* Also on the `Info` tab, Add `Type: feature` to the `Extra` field.

#### Datasets
Datasets will be a new feature in an upcomming Zetore release. For now, set `Item Type` to `Journal Article`.
In order to distinguish dataset items from regular journal articles inside Zotero, the following should be added on a separate line into the `Extra` field: `itemType: Dataset`.

_Note that this is inconsistent with the naming scheme in this manual._

#### Conference poster or presentation
Use `Item Type` `Presentation`, set the field `Type` to either `Conference Poster` or `Conference Presentation`.

#### Workshop, lecture, or demonstration
Use `Item Type` `Presentation`, set the field `Type` to `Workshop`, `Lecture`, or `Demonstration`.

#### Other Presentations
Please add presentations if they are external, e.g. not presentations held at the eScience Center or at project partners' locations.
If you want to publish the slides this can be done at [Zenodo](www.zenodo.org) or [Figshare](www.figshare.com); both will provide a DOI and online viewer.
Use `Item Type` `Presentation`.

#### Manuscript
These are peer reviewed publications in submission, under review, or in preparation.
Use `Item Type` `Manuscript`, add to the `Extra` field:
- `submittedAt: date`
- `submittedTo: journal`

#### Report
If you have scientific output that has not been peer reviewed, use `Item Type` `Report`.
For instance: reports, white papers, etc.

If available, add the DOI to the `Extra` field as `DOI: `

#### Thesis
A PhD, Master, or Bachelor thesis.
Set `Item Type` to `Thesis` and fill in `Bachelor`, `Master`, `PhD` in the `Type` field.
If relevant, enter `Supervisor:` and or `Promotor:` `Co-promotor:` with the appropriate name to the `Extra` field.

#### Other types
Please choose the most appropriate type from `Blogpost`, `Book`, `Book Section`, `Interview`, `Magazine Article`, `Newspaper Article`, `Podcast`, `Radio Broadcast`, `TV Broadcast`, `Video Recording`, `Webpage`.
And make a best-effort at filling out the other metadata on the `Info` tab.

### Linking output
For the RSD we would like to show the links between projects, people, papers, software, and data.
Output is already linked to projects via the folders in the Zotero library, and it is also linked to persons via the `Author` metadata.
However, for presentations and publications covering a specific piece of software or dataset we need to enter this link manually.
1. Select the item, `Computer Program` or dataset (which is a `Journal Article` with `Extra` set to `itemType: Dataset`)
2. In the right hand panel, select the `Related` tab
3. Press the `Add` button
4. Select the related output from the pop up window.
5. Press `Ok`
6. Sync the Zotero library
